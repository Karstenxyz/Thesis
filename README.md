# DAO Proposal Analysis

This repository contains the code and data for analyzing Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO) proposals, focusing on their characteristics and impact on decentralized governance.

## Project Structure

The repository is organized into the following directories:

1. `1_Data_Collection`: Scripts and tools used for collecting DAO proposal data from Snapshot.org.
2. `2_Data_Cleaning`: Code for preprocessing and cleaning the collected data.
3. `3_Data_analysis`: Scripts for analyzing proposal characteristics and correlations.
4. `4_Clustering`: Implementation of K-means clustering and silhouette analysis for categorizing proposals.
5. `Datasets`: Contains the raw and processed datasets used in the analysis.

## Key Features

- Analysis of 4,769 proposals from 91 unique DAOs
- Exploration of proposal characteristics such as duration, voting options, and network support
- Clustering of proposals into categories using K-means algorithm
- Correlation analysis to uncover relationships between proposal variables
